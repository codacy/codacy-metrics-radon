This is the docker engine we use at Codacy to have [Radon](https://github.com/rubik/radon) support.

## Requirements

* Python
* Radon
* Java 8+

## Usage

You can create the docker by doing:

```bash
./scripts/publish.sh
```

The docker is ran with the following command:

```bash
docker run -it -v $srcDir:/src  <DOCKER_NAME>:<DOCKER_VERSION>
docker run -it -v $PWD/src/test/resources:/src codacy/codacy-metrics-radon:latest
```

## Test

1) Install Radon:

    * With Pip:
    
        ```bash
        pip install radon
        ```

    * Or download [radon's source code](https://github.com/rubik/radon) and run the setup file:
    
        ```bash
        python setup.py install
        ```

2) After that, you can run the tests:

    ```bash
    ./scripts/test.sh
    ```
